# Machine-learning-models

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It leverages algorithms to identify patterns within data, enabling systems to improve their performance over time. 

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
